            <img src="img/about-img.jpg" alt="about me"><br/>
            <p>Samsung Electronics is relentless in our efforts to deliver innovative products and experiences that maximise user
                convenience and make the lives of consumers better. In 2016, we saw an increase in sales throughout Asia in addition to
                revenue growth across premium appliance markets in North America, Europe, and Korea. Most of all, Samsung’s market share
                ranked first in the US, a key market for home appliance brands. This year, we launched innovative products that shifted
                market paradigms, like the FamilyHub refrigerator, AddWash washing machine, and WindFree air conditioner. They continue to
                garner positive feedback from our consumers. We also focused on strengthening and expanding our business with a new
                built-in lineup and system air conditioners. In 2017, we will continue to bring real value to consumers by launching
                differentiated products and technologies. Our ground-breaking and consumer-focused products will challenge routines and
                stereotypes, leading the market by delivering true innovation and convenience to our valued consumers. We will maintain our
                market leadership position with premium, innovative products like the FamilyHub refrigerator featuring advanced voice
                recognition technology that is guaranteed to improve family communication, the FlexWash washing machine which can support
                two simultaneous or separate washes of different clothing capacities and fabric types, and the WindFree air conditioner
                for staying cool without direct wind. In addition, we are continuing to invest in revolutionizing products and distribution
                methods for our high-growth, high-profit B2B business. </p>
